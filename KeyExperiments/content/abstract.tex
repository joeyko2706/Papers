\section*{Preface}

The summary of the course "Key Experiments of Particle Physics" from the winter semester of 2023/2024 will summarise one presentation from each session respectively.
It will be sorted not by the dates of the individual presentations but by the respective historical events.
The first chapter will be about semiconductors as they are used in the following experiments, except for the Wu experiment, and are thus a fundamental aspect of the detection of elementary particles.
The Wu experiment will be the second chapter being discussed, which provided the first experimental evidence for the violation of parity conservation in the weak interaction in 1956, leading to theoretical structures such as the $(V-A)$-structure and the CKM-Matrix and thus laying the foundation for particle physics.
The next chapter focuses on the discovery of the gluon in 1978, which took a significant step in the acceptance of the Standard Model of Particles (SM) \cite{Gaillard1998ui} as there had only been the photon discovered as one of the force-exchanging particles at the time \cite{DesyGluon}.
The last chapter will revise the oscillation of B-mesons ...
